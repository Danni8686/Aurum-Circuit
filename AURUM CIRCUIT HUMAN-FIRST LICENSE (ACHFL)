LICENSE

This protects:

• your ownership
• your intentions
• your no-weaponisation rule
• your requirement for credit
• your human-first purpose
• your ethical boundaries
• your right to stop misuse
• your universe and concept structure

Nothing in this license carries my personality — it’s written in standard legal-style language so it looks legitimate, firm, and universal.
