# Aurum Circuit – Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the high-level development path for the Aurum Circuit.
It is intentionally light to keep the project focused, ethical, and human-first.

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Current)
• Establish core documentation  
• Publish Universe Bible  
• Publish Whitepaper  
• Define ethics: No-Harm Charter + ACHFL License  
• Structure the Suit System  
• Open repository for visibility and collaboration  

## Phase 2 — Concept Refinement
• Create simple diagrams of the four Suits  
• Map bio-digital flow between suits  
• Document basic energy and mobility model  
• Define minimal viable prototype concepts (non-mechanical)  
• Engage ethical reviewers and disability advocates  

## Phase 3 — Research Alignment
• Identify compatible existing technologies  
• Connect with universities or research groups  
• Explore lightweight materials, sensors, and soft robotics  
• Begin small-scale conceptual modeling  
• Validate safety and use-case boundaries  

## Phase 4 — Prototype Exploration
• Non-commercial mockups or soft exo-skin trials  
• Limited-scope volunteer user feedback  
• Accessibility-first testing approach  

## Phase 5 — Integration & Partnerships
• Seek aligned partners (health, accessibility, gaming innovation, mobility tech)  
• Ensure all partners adopt the No-Harm Charter  
• Expand documentation for developer engagement  

## Phase 6 — Long-Term Vision
• A universal, human-first exo-skin  
• Ethical technology blending health, mobility, and protection  
• Open framework for future generations  

This roadmap may evolve as new insights, safety findings, and ethical considerations emerge.
