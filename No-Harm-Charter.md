AURUM CIRCUIT — NO HARM CHARTER

A Safety, Ethics & Human-First Commitment

The Aurum Circuit and all related Suit systems (Heart, Spade, Club, Diamond) are explicitly designed as supportive, non-weaponised, benevolent technologies.

They exist for one purpose:

to reduce human suffering — not to create it.

This charter outlines the ethical foundation of the Aurum Circuit.

⸻

1. No Weaponisation

The Aurum Circuit may not be used to create:

• weapons
• offensive technology
• military attack systems
• harm-enhancing tools
• coercive control systems
• surveillance exploitation

The system is a support layer, not a combat platform.

⸻

2. Human Autonomy First

Users must always retain:

• control
• choice
• agency
• bodily independence

No suit or module may override a human’s will or behaviour.

⸻

3. Protection, Not Force

The Club Suit (Defence) is designed only for:

• impact absorption
• hazard resistance
• personal safety
• emergency response

It cannot be repurposed to harm, intimidate, or restrain others.

⸻

4. Transparency of Intent

The original purpose of the Aurum Circuit must remain visible:

support those who are vulnerable, tired, overworked, injured, ageing, or unsafe.

Any future development must remain aligned with:

• health
• mobility
• stability
• protection
• compassion

⸻

5. Privacy & Dignity

All body data, motion data, and health signals must be:

• private
• secure
• user-owned
• never sold
• never used to manipulate behaviour

The Aurum Circuit is a shield, not a surveillance tool.

⸻

6. Accessibility & Equality

The system should prioritise those who benefit most:

• people with injuries
• people with disabilities
• ageing populations
• labourers under high physical strain
• first responders
• everyday commuters

Technology is only as good as the lives it improves.

⸻

7. Ethical Development Path

All future collaboration with corporations, R&D groups, or institutions must honour this charter.

If any partner attempts to weaponise, exploit, or distort the purpose, collaboration must cease.

⸻

8. Commitment Statement

By publishing this charter, Danielle Austin formally establishes:

The Aurum Circuit must never be used to harm a human being, directly or indirectly.

It is designed to support, strengthen, stabilise, protect, and empower —
never to injure, dominate, or endanger.
